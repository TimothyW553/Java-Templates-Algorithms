/* 
 * For a function f which maps a finite set S to itself and any
 * initial value x0 in S, the sequence of iterated values:
 * x_0, x_1 = f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1), ... x_i = f(x_(i-1))
 * must eventually use the same value twice: there must be some
 * i <> j such that xi = xj. Once this happens, the sequence
 * must continue periodically, by repeating the same sequence
 * of values from x_i to x_(j-1). Cycle detection asks to find
 * i and j, given the function f(x) and x_0.
 * 
 * Floyd's cycle finding algorithm uses two points that move through the sequence at different speeds.
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(length of cycle * first index of cycle)
 *
