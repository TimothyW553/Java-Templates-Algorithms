/* 
 * For a function f which maps a finite set S to itself and any initial value x0 in S, the sequence of iterated values:
 * x_0, x_1 = f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1), ... x_i = f(x_(i-1)) must eventually use the same value twice: there must be some
 * i <> j such that xi = xj. Once this happens, the sequence must continue periodically, by repeating the same sequence
 * of values from x_i to x_(j-1). Cycle detection asks to find i and j, given the function f(x) and x_0.
 * 
 * Brent's cycle-detection algorithm searches for the smallest power of two that is larger than both the length of the cycle
 * and the first index of the cycle.
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(length of cycle * first index of cycle)
 *
