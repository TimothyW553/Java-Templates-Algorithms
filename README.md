# Java Template and Algorrithms

Compilation of all the Java Algorithms, Datastrutures, Dynamic Programming, and Graph Theory templates that I currently know of

Under the Java_Templates_Algorithms, you will find my Java template Algorithms to various types of questions (e.g. 0-1 Knapsack, which uses dp). The 
Algorithms are organized under the type of algorithm they use (Dp, Graph, etc...)

Algorithm sets are organized into different folders
